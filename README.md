## Top 10 Machine Learning Algorithms For Beginners: Supervised, Unsupervised Learning and More

The many different types of machine learning algorithms have been designed in such dynamic times to help solve real-world complex problems. The ml algorithms are automated and self-modifying to continue improving over time. Before we delve into the top 10 machine learning algorithms you should know, let's take a look at the different types of machine learning algorithms and how they are classified. 

Machine learning algorithms are classified into 4 types:

Supervised

Unsupervised Learning

Semi-supervised Learning

Reinforcement Learning

However, these four types of ml algorithms are further classified into more types.
